Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm here to share my research projects, side endeavors, and insights with you.

### What You'll Find Here

I'll be sharing updates about my scientific journey, which includes my research projects as well as side endeavors that have piqued my interest. What I also strive to showcase in this blog is my dedication to practicality. I believe in learning by doing, so I'll include `code` snippets in my posts to help you put ideas into action.

```python
def print_hello(name="World")
    print(f"Hello, {}!") # I love using f-strings
print_hello('Tim') # Say hello to the famous beaver
# prints 'Hello, World!' to `sys.stdout`.
```

### ICASSP 2024 Grand Challenge

Before I wrap this up, let me mention the ICASSP 2024 Grand Challenge, a project my MIT team and I have been working on. It has been years in the making (nurtured during the course of my PhD). It's an exciting opportunity to push the boundaries of our field. If you are interested, check out the [RFChallenge](https://rfchallenge.mit.edu/icassp24-single-channel/).

Thanks for joining me on this journey of exploration. Keep an eye out for upcoming posts/updates!
