In the modern wireless landscape, the radio frequency (RF) spectrum is becoming overcrowded due to the proliferation of devices emitting RF signals, often causing interference and performance degradation in wireless communication systems. This research centers on the complex task of disentangling these co-existing and co-channel signals with the constraint of measurements from a single sensor---thereby lacking in spatial diversity. Our efforts are focused on separating these signals into their individual components, as well as in identifying and demodulating a particular "signal-of-interest" from the signal mixture. To address this challenge, we look towards data-driven solutions, enabled by the availability of a diverse training dataset to support machine learning techniques, in capturing signal structures that enable effective separation or demodulation of RF signal mixtures based on single-sensor measurements.
