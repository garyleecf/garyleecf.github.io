In the modern wireless landscape, the radio frequency (RF) spectrum is becoming overcrowded due to the proliferation of radio-frequency (RF) devices, often causing interference and performance degradation in wireless communication systems. This research centers on the complex task of disentangling these co-existing and co-channel signals with the constraint of measurements from a single sensor---thereby lacking in spatial diversity. Our efforts are focused on separating these signals into their individual components, as well as in identifying and demodulating a particular "signal-of-interest" from the signal mixture. To address this challenge, we look towards data-driven solutions, enabled by the availability of a diverse training dataset to support machine learning techniques, in capturing signal structures that enable effective separation or demodulation of RF signal mixtures based on single-sensor measurements.
